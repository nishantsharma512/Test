        Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
        
        By default, your repository has one branch named main that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can create additional branches off of main in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time. This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.
        
        When     you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.<blockquote>

            Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.
            
            Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.
            
            As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.</blockquote>

    <blockquote cite="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world"><b>Merging your pull request</b>b><br>
            In this final step, you will merge your readme-edits branch into the main branch. After you merge your pull request, the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into main.
            
            Sometimes, a pull request may introduce changes to code that conflict with the existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will alert you about the conflicting code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.
            
            In this walk-through, you should not have any conflicts, so you are ready to merge your branch into the main branch.</blockquote>
